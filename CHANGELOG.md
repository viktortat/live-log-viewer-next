# Changelog

All notable changes to `agent-log-viewer` are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) (0.x — the API may still move).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.11.2] — 2026-07-08

### Added
- Task curator API: `/api/tasks/curator` surfaces recent real user inputs with
  transcript context and accepts short curated proposals that become board
  tasks with source fingerprints. `GET` scopes to every project or one via
  `?project=`, and returns a `projects` discovery list — so an automation can
  poke the viewer from anywhere and capture all boards or a single one.
- Resource cleanup now has a guarded "kill all agents" control for a deliberate
  clean slate across tracked agent panes.

### Changed
- Automatic task inbox capture is opt-in through `LLV_ENABLE_AUTO_TASK_INBOX=1`.

### Fixed
- Finished Codex worktree sessions under `~/.codex/worktrees/<id>/<repo>` keep
  grouping under the parent repo after the ephemeral checkout disappears.
- Workflow setup no longer reports a just-launched command as "interrupted": a
  short settle window anchored on the launch artifact absorbs the spawn/exit
  race between the pid becoming visible and the exit-code trailer landing.

## [0.11.1] — 2026-07-08

### Added
- Composer send now has a compact context menu with a quick "Yes, continue"
  action, mirroring the microphone backend menu pattern.

### Fixed
- Orphaned workflow records no longer keep missing repositories visible in the
  project rail. A workflow is listed only when its workspace still exists or a
  linked transcript is present in the current scan.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added
- Docker runtime: a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` build `.next` inside
  the image from a clean environment and run the viewer with host parity — host
  network and PID namespace, the real `/home/latand` tree and tmux socket, and
  `nsenter` shims that exec the exact host `claude`/`codex`/`bun`/`uv`/`tmux`.
  Prod runs as the `viewer` service on `127.0.0.1:8898` with
  `restart: unless-stopped`; a `test` profile brings up a second instance on
  another port. Reproducibility, not isolation — see `docs/docker.md`.
- Idle conversation roots now appear in the quiet history list even when they
  head an active group, marked to set them apart from fully-quiet roots.

### Changed
- The prod deployment moved from the `agent-log-viewer.service` systemd user
  unit to Docker Compose; the systemd unit is disabled. `scripts/rebuild.sh`
  now rebuilds and redeploys the container (still verifying the served CSS the
  HTML references returns 200).
- Removed Codex companion-job support. The viewer no longer scans, links, or
  renders `~/.claude/plugins/data/codex-openai-codex/state` jobs — the
  `codex-jobs` root and its parentage linking are gone. Codex spawning was
  never routed through the companion plugin (it uses tmux directly), so
  spawn behavior is unchanged.

### Fixed
- Spawning an agent survives a deleted tmux server cwd: the pane receives an
  explicit `cd` into the target directory before the boot command, so a stale
  server working directory no longer aborts the launch.
- An archived project revives when an agent inside it is running again: an
  idle-but-running conversation un-hides its project instead of staying hidden.

## [0.9.3] — 2026-07-07

### Changed
- Task cards hand off instead of firing. Dropping a task's arrow onto a live
  agent (or clicking a routed target) now seeds that pane's composer with the
  task text and never auto-sends; a removable link records where it was routed,
  and a "detach" action unlinks an assignment. Quiet projects render on the
  canvas with a scheme/list view toggle. Message-feed images referenced by a
  local path embed inline instead of showing as bare links.
- Resumed sessions are matched to their running process. Transcript→pid
  attribution now recognizes `--resume <id>` and `codex resume <id>`, so a
  resumed pane is correctly identified in the viewer.

### Fixed
- Handoff assignments persist. The task store validator accepts the `handoff`
  state, so a task routed to a pane is no longer dropped on the next load.

### Security
- The local image proxy (`/api/image`) is hardened: it rejects cross-origin and
  DNS-rebind requests (same Host/Origin gate as the mutating routes), resolves
  symlinks and re-checks home containment before reading, and no longer serves
  SVG inline (which could run same-origin script).

## [0.9.1] — 2026-07-06

### Changed
- The codebase is English by default: hardcoded Ukrainian strings (API error
  responses, display labels, transcribe messages) and internal `kind`/`project`
  values are now English. The Ukrainian UI locale (`src/lib/i18n/uk.ts`) and the
  CLI's Ukrainian messages are unchanged, so a uk locale still gets a Ukrainian
  UI; only the default and the non-localized internals moved to English.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-07-06

### Fixed
- CLI no longer kills its own healthy server on startup. The readiness probe
  reused the 200 ms poll interval as its per-request socket timeout, but the
  probe hits `/api/files`, which scans every log under `~/.claude` and
  `~/.codex`; past a few hundred conversations that scan takes 250–600 ms, so
  every probe aborted early and the launcher declared a timeout after 15 s. The
  probe now has its own 5 s socket timeout.
- No more "nothing found" flash while the conversation list loads. The sidebar,
  switchboard and mobile focus view showed their empty state on first paint,
  before the first `/api/files` response arrived; they now show a loading
  spinner until the first fetch settles.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-06

### Added
- Mobile shell: trimmed pane chips, composer tools folded behind one toggle,
  attention badge in the header.
- Feed copy affordances: inline monospace chips copy themselves on click;
  code blocks and command outputs get a hover copy button, with a clipboard
  fallback for plain-http LAN origins.

### Changed
- Dictation starts faster: mic acquisition overlaps a prewarmed live token.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-06

The board fast path — the release that makes the scheme keep up with a dozen
live agents at once.

### Added
- Server-push log tailing: `GET /api/logs/stream` (SSE over `fs.watch` with a
  safety re-stat and heartbeat); the client falls back to batched polling
  automatically when the stream drops.
- Batched channels: one `POST /api/logs` per tick for every visible pane's
  forward read (byte-budgeted), one `POST /api/tmux/targets` for all pane
  target lookups.
- `ETag`/`If-None-Match` on `/api/files` — unchanged payloads come back as a
  bodyless 304.

### Changed
- Incremental feed parsing: each pane parses only appended transcript lines;
  cross-line effects land copy-on-write, so unchanged messages keep identity
  and skip markdown re-render entirely (measured 225× less parse work per
  tick on a 10 MB transcript).
- Panes sleep when they cannot be seen: off-viewport (IntersectionObserver)
  and behind the far-zoom identity labels. Activity dots, questions and
  notifications keep riding the files poll.
- Scanner discovery and link glob scans became cooperative: async walks with
  bounded concurrency and event-loop yields, so `/api/files` no longer stalls
  log responses behind it.
- One shared 128 KB tail read+parse per growing transcript per scan instead
  of 4–6; `/proc` and tmux pane-map memos now outlive the 10 s poll.
- Pane header reworked into two rows: identity + actions on top, metadata
  chips below; cleanup list names sessions by argv session uuid.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-06

### Added
- Reasoning level and codex fast/standard toggle on every new-agent surface.
- System resources panel: RAM/swap rail block with per-agent-session memory
  (over tmux pane trees) and a stale-session cleanup panel.
- Microphone engine menu (right-click): pick the transcription backend; a
  visible "starting" state while the recording pipeline connects.
- Chime when a new subagent or agent link appears.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-05

### Changed
- Viewer state moved out of `~/.claude` into `~/.config/agent-log-viewer`
  (atomic, retryable migration of the legacy directory).
- npm releases are published from CI on tag push via trusted publishing.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-05

### Added
- Agent workflows: multi-step templates (stage → fixer → PR body) with a
  state machine, provisioning, draft cards and a docked strip.
- Task handoff arrow: hand a board task to an agent by pulling an arrow.

### Fixed
- Anchored feed scroll across layout reshuffles.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-05

### Added
- Lasso multi-select with ephemeral bulk-action sessions on the scheme board.
- Board tasks: sticky cards over the panes with delivery to agents, mobile
  task sheet with STT/images, minimap task dots.
- Attention queue («needs me») with rail counts.
- Expand any conversation pane to the full window and collapse back.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-05

### Added
- i18n (English + Ukrainian) across the UI and CLI.
- Mobile mode: focused conversation, full-screen map, project drawer.
- Live dictation UI and TUI menu cards; the scanner parses waiting TUI menus
  and answers them by key.
- Archived projects.

### Changed
- Scheme-canvas jank cut with many agents: memoized feed, rAF camera,
  smaller panes.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-07-05

### Added
- In-app QR onboarding for phone access; hardened Tailscale flow.
- Unified config dirs; short-lived transcription tokens.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-04

Initial public release, packaged as `agent-log-viewer` with a `bunx` CLI.

- Local web UI that tails Codex / Claude Code transcripts into a live
  chat-style feed with a session parentage tree.
- Project scheme canvas: conversations as cards on a pannable, zoomable
  world with parent→child arrows, minimap, review-loop cycles.
- tmux composer: message, interrupt or kill any tracked agent; spawn new
  agents; codex spawn lineage survives process exit.
- Implement→review flows with fresh headless reviewer rounds.
- Remote access over Tailscale behind a token gate.
